# FirmFlake
Embedded Systems Repository for UBC Rover

This contains all our firmware and embedded code. From both elec and software.

Shamefully, we commit build code. This will likley change soon, but we don't have all the build tools installed on each computer and before we set up a proper toolchain this removes some possible errors around building for the wrong MCU, mismatched dependencies etc.
